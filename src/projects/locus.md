## Overview

This is the one of my final year projects in the university. This game is designed mainly for students joining the orientation day. We choose them as the target players as they are going to be students studying in CUHK, it is important for them to
know the locations of different buildings and spots there since they will often go to these
places to have lessons or live there.

There are checkpoints all over the campus. By visiting
these checkpoints, they will be able to recognize the way to get to different places in CUHK.
Apart from recognizing the locations, this game provides interesting stories and background
information about the places. For example, the shape of The Gate of Wisdom is designed like
two people fighting with each other, symbolizing the intellectual interactions between
scholars.

In addition, on the orientation day, they have to choose which college they would
like to choose. By playing this game, players get to know more about the colleges and make a
more informed choice. They can also play this game for entertainment. The AR elements are
included to make the game more interactive and fun. Current CUHK students and visitors
who want to know more about CUHK can also play the game.
